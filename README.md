Please cite Gornall, Will, and Ilya A. Strebulaev. "The economic impact of venture capital: Evidence from public companies." Available at SSRN 2681841 (2021) if using this data.

The included spreadsheet classifies public firms into VC-backed and not VC-backed. This classification was produced using by linking the company names in Thomson to the historical company names in Compustat. After fuzzy merging, we reconcile those links using manual checks and reconciliation of tickers, IPO dates, and Thomson PERMIDs.

Please note that we used a restrictive definition of a VC-backed company: Later-stage deals are excluded. Please check the appendix of Gornall and Strebulaev (2015) for more details.

Attached is our firm-year level VC-backed firm identifier. A firm (gvkey) is classified to be a VC-backed firm in a given year (fyear) if 'Count as VC==1'.
